## Introduction
This repository contains the quiz and programming assignment solutions to the course as I work through the course. It will be updated regularly as I document my journey through this course. (Date Started: 3 December 2020).

The quiz and programming assignment solutions are uploaded only for reference purposes. Please attempt the quizzes and programming assignments yourself and only look at the explanations if you find that you still can't understand it after consulting the discussion forums and reviewing the lecture content.
